One afternoon, he wakes up and notices that his body feels a little off. Finding that strange, he goes to reach for his tablet, but what does he see in his reflection, but an adorable young lady. I wonder what lies in store for the \"former\" big brother, Mahiro as he's thrust headfirst into his new life as a girl.",
